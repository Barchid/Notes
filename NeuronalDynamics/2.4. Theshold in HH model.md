# 2.4. Threshold in HH model

Now we understand the 

- Where is threshold to generate spikes
- When we inject strong intensity, there is spikes at some period
- Depending on the intensity, there is a higher frequency
- F-I curve = frequence-intensity curve
  - There is a minimal current where there is a period but under this, there is no spike
- Threshold for repetitive firing 
- Threshold corresponds to minimal current
- Really current threshold ? not really true
- Instead of constant current, we use short current (pulse input)
- Pulse is high = action potential created
- Pulse decreased in intensity = no spike
- So threshold current ?
- Shorter pulse but high intensity 
  - no spike
  - Not current
- System of 4 diff equatons
  - Sod current, leak current, pota current & stimulation current
  - No threshold
- When intense pulse but very short
  - We have jump of voltage
  - $m$ sodium gating variable increases because u increases ($m$ tends to $m_0$ that increases depending on $u$)
  - Because $u$ exploded, $m$ exploded so the membrane potential strongly increases
  - So spike ! But why does it stop somewhere and not goes to infinity ?
    - Stop because of $h$ because it will go to 0 ? (if h is 0, gates are closed.)
    - h important but even without it, there is another explanation
    - Explodes because of reversial potential of +30mV above resting potential
    - If voltage goes to +30mV, the reversial potential makes the term = 0, so the sodium current will stop
- Why start the explanation with m and not h ?
  - voltage increases, h decreased so no explosion ?
  - m has a time constant $\tau$ faster than $h$ so the h gating variable reacts more slowly so we start with $m$ because it is the first to interact
- For a given stimulation paradigm (short pulse input e.g.)
  - There is a voltage threshold where the $m$ dynamic becomes unstables and makes the mem potential explode
- Follow and understand the action potental
- $m$ is first, $h$ and $n$ comes later
- Where is the threshold ?
  - There is no threshold
  - A given stimulation paradigm can define a threshold but changing the stimulation makes the threshold different
- H-H 
  - No strict threshold
  - Coupled differential equations
- Short current pulse which is just enough to spike
  - Just 5 ms later, the same pulse = no spike
  - Same 10ms later
  - But much later, when use the same short pulse, there is a spike
  - Known as refractoriness
- In vivo :
  - some time-dependent current
  - HH model generates spike train
  - the subtreshold fluctuate
- Step current input paradigm
  - Start with certain value, then suddenly a step to a new current value
  - the step size is $\delta_i$
  - Measure repetitive firing 
  - But not always, depends on the step size 
  - for step current, it does not depends on the final currant, but the step size
- No threshold
- Effective threshold depends on typical input
- Type II firing behavior :
  - HH model with standard params (giant axon of squid)
- Type I firing behavior
  - Smooth f-I curve, with params for cortial pyramidal neuron e.g.
- Summarize :
  - 4 equations solved in computer
  - No strict firing threshold
  - For practical purposes, we can approximate a voltage threshold
  - More ion channels can exist, but same framework
  - Here, we discuss the giant axon of the squid (cortical neurons)
