# 2.1. Biophysics of neurons

## Review of 1st chapter 
Neurons communicate by exchanging action potentiels known as "spikes". A spike occurs when the membrane potential of a neuron exceeds a certain threshold. Several neuron models are defined to express the membrane potential and the occuring of spikes. The 1st chapter introduces Integrate and fire model, which defines the spikes as formal events triggered at threshold that influence the membrane potential of postsynaptic neurons. It also introduces refactoriness, leak and several other mechanisms.

## Biophysics of neurons
In this 2nd chapter, we want to understand how spikes can be generated based on the biophysics of cell membrane.

A neuron has a membrane (like any other cell). This membrane containes ion pumps which drain $Na^{+}$ ions from inside to outside of the cell. The membrane also contains ion channels that are special proteins that can change their shape to make ions flow inside or outside the cell.

On the other hand, a difference in potential between the inside and outside of the cell is measured.

For this chapter, we want to answer three questions :
1. How does the resting potential between inside & outside arise ?
2. Ions flow through ion channels but, in which direction ?
3. How neurons can emit spikes, according to biophysics ?

All of this will lead us to the **Hodgkin-Huxley model**.
